### Hi, I'm Felix. ðŸ‘‹  

I'm currently pursuing my **MSc in Artificial Intelligence** and I am deeply fascinated by learning systemsâ€”how they work, how they fail, and what fundamental principles drive today's impressive AI capabilities. My interests range from **Deep Learning** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning** to the theoretical underpinnings of intelligence itself.  

> **The most interesting question to me:**  
> Is *"just"* pure interpolative, high-dimensional pattern matching enough to achieve AGI?  

Here, Iâ€™ll showcase some personal projects, experiments, and thoughts on these topics.  
Always happy to discuss ideasâ€”feel free to connect! ðŸš€
